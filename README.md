# TimeZonebot
Discord bot for TimeZones

This has 3 main functionalities:

!tzregister <timezone> : Links the specified timezone to your user

!tz <userid> <time to convert> : Converts the time provided into that user's local time. Note: if you do not specify a time, it will use the current time.

!tzall <timezone> : Displays all users who belong to the specified timezone.

Other general comments: 
- You will need to register before this works. I'll do some error catching later but for now, play nice please!
